Every chapter is written in a bite-sized manner and straight to the point as I don't want to waste your time (and most certainly mine) on the content you don't need. In the end, you will have the skills to create a Movies review app and deploy it to the Internet. In the course of this book, we will cover: Chapter 1: Introduction Chapter 2: MongoDB Overview Chapter 3: Setting Up MongoDB Atlas Cloud Database Chapter 4: Adding Sample Data Chapter 5: Setting Up Our Node.js, Express Backend Chapter 6: Creating Our Backend Server Chapter 7: Creating The Movies Data Access Object Chapter 8: Creating The Movies Controller Chapter 9: Testing Our Backend API Chapter 10: Leaving Movie Reviews Chapter 11: Testing The Reviews API Chapter 12: Route To Get A Single Movie And Its Ratings Chapter 13: Introduction To React Chapter 14: Create Navigation Header Bar Chapter 15: Defining Our Routes Chapter 16: MovieDataService: Connecting To The Backend Chapter 17: MoviesList Component Chapter 18: Movie Component Chapter 19: Listing Reviews Chapter 21: Adding And Editing Reviews Chapter 22: Deleting A Review Chapter 23: Get Next Page's Results Chapter 24: Get Next Page's Results - Search By Title And Rating Chapter 25: Deploying Backend On Heroku Chapter 26: Hosting And Deploying Our React Frontend The goal of this book is to teach you MERN stack development in a manageable way without overwhelming you. We focus only on the essentials and cover the material in a hands-on practice manner for you to code along. Working Through This Book This book is purposely broken down into short chapters where the development process of each chapter will center on different essential topics. The book takes a practical hands on approach to learning through practice. You learn best when you code along with the examples in the book. Requirements No previous knowledge on Node.js or React development is required, but you should have basic programming knowledge. It will be a helpful advantage if you could read through my Node, Express book and React book first which will provide you will better insight and deeper knowledge into the various technologies. But even if you have not done so, you should still be able to follow along.",

You will see how Node.js is focused on creating high-performing, highly-scalable websites, and how easy it is to get started. Many front-end devs regularly work with HTML, CSS, PHP, even WordPress, but haven't yet got started with Node.js. This book explains everything for you from a beginner level, enabling you to start using Node.js in your projects right away.<p>Using this book you will learn important Node.js concepts for server-side programming. You will begin with an easy-to-follow pure JavaScript primer, which you can skip if you're confident of your JS skills. You'll then delve into Node.js concepts such as streams and events, and the technology involved in building full-stack Node.js applications. You'll also learn how to test your Node.js code, and deploy your Node.js applications on the internet.<p>Node.js is a great and simple platform to work with. It is lightweight, easy to deploy and manage. You will see how using Node.js can be a fun and rewarding experience - start today with <em>Beginning Node.js</em>.</p>",

With each of them a JavaScript or JavaScript-based technology, having a shared programming language means it takes less time to develop web applications.<p>This book focuses on providing key tasks that can help you get started, learn, understand, and build full-stack web applications. It walks you through the process of installing all the requirements and project setup to build client-side React web applications, managing synchronous and asynchronous data flows with Redux, and building real-time web applications with Socket.IO, RESTful APIs, and other concepts. This book gives you practical and clear hands-on experience so you can begin building a full-stack MERN web application.<p>Quick Start Guides are focused, shorter titles that provide a faster paced introduction to a technology. They are for people who don't need all the detail at this point in their learning curve.
